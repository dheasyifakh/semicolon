                    classes from Tailwind CSS. It also includes interactive elements such as dropdowns, modals,

                <p>Before going digital, you might benefit from scribbling down some ideas in a sketchbook. This way,
                    you can think things through before committing to an actual design project.</p>
                <p>But then I found a <a href="https://flowbite.com">component library based on Tailwind CSS called
                        Flowbite</a>. It comes with the most commonly used UI components, such as buttons, navigation
                    bars, cards, form elements, and more which are conveniently built with the utility classes from
                    Tailwind CSS.</p>
